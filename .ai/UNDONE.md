## Risk Mitigation
- **Coqui STT/TTS Model Issues**: Have fallback models and test thoroughly
- **Audio Device Compatibility**: Test on multiple platforms and devices
- **Network Dependency**: Implement offline fallback modes
- **Performance Issues**: Profile early and optimize iteratively
- **Complex Integration**: Use proper design patterns and modular architecture

## Development Principles
- **Plan Before Code**: No implementation without corresponding design
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests based on BDD scenarios
- **SOLID Principles**: Maintain clean, extensible architecture
- **GoF Design Patterns**: Use appropriate patterns for system design
- **Behavior-Driven**: Focus on user scenarios and requirements
- **Investigate Don't Switch**: Debug thoroughly before changing approach
