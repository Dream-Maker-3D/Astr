# Natural Conversation Requirements

## Core Conversational Principles

### 1. No Activation Words or Prompts ‚ùå
- **Traditional**: "Hey Assistant, what's the weather?"
- **Natural**: User just starts talking, system responds naturally

### 2. Continuous Listening Mode üéß
- System is always listening for natural speech
- No button presses or wake words required
- Automatic voice activity detection (VAD) determines when user is speaking
- Seamless transition between listening and responding

### 3. Human-Like Response Patterns üó£Ô∏è
- **Concise responses** - avoid verbose explanations unless asked
- **Natural speech patterns** - use contractions, pauses, hesitations when appropriate
- **Conversational acknowledgments** - "mm-hmm", "I see", "right" for natural flow
- **Turn-taking cues** - implicit signals when ready for user response

### 4. Interruption Handling ü§ù
- **Immediate stop** - halt speech generation the moment user starts speaking
- **Context preservation** - remember what was being said when interrupted
- **Graceful resumption** - handle "sorry, continue" or topic changes
- **No offense taken** - treat interruptions as natural conversation flow

### 5. Correction and Clarification üîÑ
- **Accept corrections** - "No, I meant..." should be handled smoothly
- **Ask for clarification naturally** - "What do you mean by that?" not "ERROR: Invalid input"
- **Self-correction** - "Actually, let me rephrase that..." when appropriate
- **Topic switching** - follow natural conversation tangents

## Updated System States

### Conversational States (replacing traditional voice assistant states)
```python
class ConversationState(Enum):
    LISTENING = "listening"           # Always listening for natural speech
    PROCESSING = "processing"         # Understanding what was said
    THINKING = "thinking"             # Generating response (can be interrupted)
    SPEAKING = "speaking"             # Delivering response (can be interrupted)
    PAUSED = "paused"                # Temporarily paused by interruption
    CLARIFYING = "clarifying"        # Asking for clarification
```

### Key State Behaviors
- **LISTENING**: Continuous, no visual indicators, natural VAD
- **PROCESSING**: Brief, seamless transition
- **THINKING**: Can show subtle "thinking" cues (optional)
- **SPEAKING**: Natural speech with interruption detection
- **PAUSED**: Graceful handling of interruptions
- **CLARIFYING**: Natural question asking, not error messages

## Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Requirements

### Continuous VAD Parameters
```yaml
vad:
  mode: "continuous"              # Always listening
  sensitivity: "medium"           # Balance false positives/negatives
  speech_threshold: 0.02          # Lower than typical assistant
  silence_timeout: 2.0            # Seconds of silence before processing
  interruption_threshold: 0.05    # Immediate interruption detection
  background_adaptation: true     # Adapt to environment noise
  speaker_identification: false   # Single speaker assumed
```

### Natural Turn-Taking
- Detect natural speech patterns (pauses, intonation)
- Distinguish between thinking pauses and end of turn
- Handle overlapping speech gracefully
- Support backchannel responses ("mm-hmm", "yeah")

## AI Conversation Requirements

### OpenRouter API Integration for Natural Conversation
```python
# Updated conversation context for natural flow
conversation_context = {
    "system_prompt": """
    You are engaged in a natural, spoken conversation. 
    
    Key behaviors:
    - Respond as you would in face-to-face conversation
    - Be concise unless detail is specifically requested
    - Use natural speech patterns with contractions
    - Don't announce what you're doing ("I'll help you with that")
    - Handle interruptions gracefully ("Oh, you were saying?")
    - Ask clarifying questions naturally ("What kind of music?")
    - Show understanding with brief acknowledgments
    - Avoid robotic or overly formal language
    
    The user cannot see you, so don't reference visual elements.
    Responses should sound natural when spoken aloud.
    """,
    "conversation_style": "natural_spoken",
    "interruption_handling": "graceful",
    "verbosity": "conversational"  # Not "helpful" or "detailed"
}
```

### Response Processing
- **Streaming responses** - start speaking as soon as first words are generated
- **Interrupt-aware generation** - stop generating when user speaks
- **Context preservation** - maintain conversation flow across interruptions
- **Natural timing** - include appropriate pauses and pacing

## Audio Processing Updates

### Real-Time Audio Pipeline
```python
class ConversationalAudioPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.continuous_vad = True
        self.interruption_detection = True
        self.background_suppression = True
        self.natural_pauses = True
        
    async def process_audio_stream(self):
        """Continuous processing without activation"""
        while True:
            audio_chunk = await self.capture_audio()
            
            if self.is_user_speaking(audio_chunk):
                if self.system_is_speaking():
                    await self.handle_interruption()
                await self.process_speech(audio_chunk)
            
            elif self.natural_pause_detected():
                await self.process_complete_utterance()
```

### Interruption Detection
- **Real-time monitoring** during TTS playback
- **Immediate cessation** of speech output
- **Buffer management** to capture interruption content
- **Context switching** from speaking back to listening

## Updated Event Flow

### Natural Conversation Events
```python
class ConversationalEvents:
    # Natural flow events
    NATURAL_SPEECH_DETECTED = "speech.natural.detected"
    TURN_BOUNDARY_DETECTED = "turn.boundary.detected"
    INTERRUPTION_DETECTED = "interruption.detected"
    CLARIFICATION_NEEDED = "clarification.needed"
    TOPIC_SHIFT_DETECTED = "topic.shift.detected"
    
    # Response events
    RESPONSE_STREAMING_START = "response.streaming.start"
    RESPONSE_INTERRUPTED = "response.interrupted"
    RESPONSE_RESUMED = "response.resumed"
    
    # Conversation management
    CONVERSATION_PAUSE = "conversation.pause"
    CONVERSATION_RESUME = "conversation.resume"
    CONTEXT_UPDATED = "context.updated"
```

## Configuration Updates

### Conversational Configuration
```yaml
conversation:
  mode: "natural"                 # vs "command" mode
  activation_method: "none"       # No wake words
  response_style: "concise"       # vs "detailed"
  interruption_handling: "immediate"
  turn_taking: "natural"
  
  timing:
    processing_delay_max: 500ms   # Quick processing
    response_start_delay: 100ms   # Start speaking quickly
    natural_pause_detection: 1.5s
    interruption_response: 50ms   # Very fast interruption detection
  
  personality:
    verbosity: "low"              # Concise by default
    formality: "casual"           # Natural speech patterns
    acknowledgments: true         # "mm-hmm", "I see", etc.
    self_interruption: false      # Don't interrupt own responses
    
ai:
  conversation_prompt: |
    You are having a natural spoken conversation. Be concise, 
    natural, and conversational. Avoid being verbose unless 
    specifically asked for details.
  max_response_length: 100       # Tokens, keep responses short
  stream_responses: true         # Start speaking immediately
```

## Updated BDD Scenarios

### Natural Conversation Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Natural Conversation Flow
  As a user
  I want to have natural conversations without activation words
  So that it feels like talking to a person

  Scenario: Starting conversation naturally
    Given the voice assistant is running
    When I start speaking "I'm thinking about getting a dog"
    Then the system should immediately start listening
    And respond naturally without any activation prompts
    And not say "How can I help you" or similar formal responses

  Scenario: Natural interruption handling
    Given the AI is saying "Dogs make great companions because they're loyal and..."
    When I interrupt by saying "What about cats?"
    Then the AI should immediately stop speaking
    And respond to my interruption about cats
    And not reference being interrupted

  Scenario: Concise conversational responses
    Given I ask "What's the weather like?"
    When the AI responds
    Then the response should be brief and conversational
    And not include verbose explanations unless I ask for them
    And sound natural when spoken aloud

  Scenario: Natural clarification requests
    Given I say something unclear like "Can you help with that thing?"
    When the AI needs clarification
    Then it should ask naturally like "What thing are you referring to?"
    And not use formal error language or structured prompts
```

## Implementation Priority Changes

### Phase 1: Core Conversational Engine
1. **Continuous VAD system** - no activation words
2. **Real-time interruption detection** - immediate response halt
3. **Natural conversation state management** - fluid state transitions
4. **Streaming response generation** - start speaking immediately

### Phase 2: Natural Response Processing  
1. **Conversational AI prompting** - natural personality
2. **Response length optimization** - concise by default
3. **Turn-taking detection** - natural conversation boundaries
4. **Context preservation** - maintain flow across interruptions

This updated design ensures the system behaves like a natural conversation partner rather than a traditional voice assistant, meeting your requirements for seamless, human-like interaction without prompts or activation words.
