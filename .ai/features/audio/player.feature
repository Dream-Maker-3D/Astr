Feature: Audio Player Service - TTS Audio Playback
  As a voice assistant user
  I want the system to play back synthesized speech clearly
  So that I can hear the assistant's responses naturally

  Background:
    Given the Audio Player Service is initialized
    And the speaker is available and accessible
    And the Event Bus Service is running
    And the system is ready to play audio

  @smoke @critical
  Scenario: Audio Player Service initialization
    Given the Audio Player Service is not yet initialized
    When I initialize the Audio Player Service
    Then the service should detect available audio output devices
    And the service should select the default speaker
    And the service should configure audio parameters (22kHz, stereo, 16-bit)
    And the service should be ready to start playback

  @device_selection
  Scenario: Audio output device selection
    Given multiple audio output devices are available:
      | Device Name          | Device ID | Status    |
      | Built-in Speakers    | 0         | Available |
      | USB Headset          | 1         | Available |
      | Bluetooth Speaker    | 2         | Available |
    When I configure the Audio Player Service to use device "1"
    Then the service should use "USB Headset" for audio output
    And the service should confirm the device selection
    And the service should test the selected device

  @playback_basic
  Scenario: Basic audio playback
    Given the Audio Player Service is initialized
    And I have audio data to play:
      | Format | Sample Rate | Channels | Duration |
      | WAV    | 22050       | 1        | 2.5s     |
    When I request audio playback
    Then the service should start playing the audio
    And a "PLAYBACK_STARTED" event should be published
    And the audio should play through the selected output device
    And a "PLAYBACK_FINISHED" event should be published when complete

  @queue_management
  Scenario: Audio queue management
    Given the Audio Player Service is running
    And I have multiple audio clips to play:
      | Clip ID | Duration | Priority |
      | clip1   | 1.0s     | normal   |
      | clip2   | 2.0s     | normal   |
      | clip3   | 0.5s     | high     |
    When I queue all clips for playback
    Then the clips should be queued in priority order
    And high priority clips should play before normal priority
    And the queue should process clips sequentially

  @interruption_handling
  Scenario: Immediate playback interruption
    Given the Audio Player Service is playing audio
    And the current playback duration is 3.0 seconds
    And 1.5 seconds have elapsed
    When I request immediate interruption
    Then the current playback should stop immediately
    And a "PLAYBACK_INTERRUPTED" event should be published
    And the audio queue should be cleared
    And the service should be ready for new audio

  @volume_control
  Scenario: Volume control during playback
    Given the Audio Player Service is initialized
    And the current volume is set to 0.8
    When I adjust the volume to 0.5
    Then the volume should be updated immediately
    And ongoing playback should reflect the new volume
    And the volume change should be persistent

  @format_conversion
  Scenario: Audio format conversion
    Given the Audio Player Service supports multiple formats
    And I have audio data in different formats:
      | Format | Sample Rate | Channels | Bit Depth |
      | MP3    | 44100       | 2        | 16        |
      | WAV    | 16000       | 1        | 16        |
      | FLAC   | 48000       | 2        | 24        |
    When I request playback of each format
    Then the service should convert formats as needed
    And all audio should play at the configured output format
    And no quality degradation should occur

  @streaming_playback
  Scenario: Streaming audio playback
    Given the Audio Player Service supports streaming
    And I have a continuous audio stream from TTS
    When I start streaming playback
    Then the service should play audio as it arrives
    And buffering should prevent audio dropouts
    And latency should be minimized (<100ms)
    And the stream should handle variable chunk sizes

  @error_handling
  Scenario: Audio device error handling
    Given the Audio Player Service is playing audio
    When the audio output device becomes unavailable
    Then the service should detect the device failure
    And an "AUDIO_DEVICE_ERROR" event should be published
    And the service should attempt to use a fallback device
    And playback should resume if possible
    And appropriate error logging should occur

  @performance_optimization
  Scenario: Low-latency audio playback
    Given the Audio Player Service is optimized for real-time playback
    And I have TTS audio ready for immediate playback
    When I request immediate playback
    Then the audio should start playing within 50ms
    And the total latency should be less than 100ms
    And CPU usage should remain below 10%
    And memory usage should be efficient

  @concurrent_playback
  Scenario: Handle concurrent playback requests
    Given the Audio Player Service is playing audio
    And the current playback has 2 seconds remaining
    When I receive a new high-priority playback request
    Then the current playback should be interrupted
    And the new audio should start immediately
    And the interrupted audio should be discarded
    And appropriate events should be published

  @audio_quality
  Scenario: Audio quality validation
    Given the Audio Player Service is configured for high quality
    And I have reference audio with known characteristics
    When I play the reference audio
    Then the output should maintain the original quality
    And no distortion should be introduced
    And the frequency response should be accurate
    And dynamic range should be preserved

  @resource_management
  Scenario: Proper resource cleanup
    Given the Audio Player Service has been running
    And multiple audio clips have been played
    When I shutdown the Audio Player Service
    Then all audio streams should be closed properly
    And audio buffers should be released
    And device handles should be cleaned up
    And no memory leaks should occur

  @integration_events
  Scenario: Event Bus integration
    Given the Audio Player Service is integrated with the Event Bus
    And event handlers are registered for audio events
    When various playback operations occur
    Then appropriate events should be published:
      | Operation          | Event Type           |
      | Start playback     | PLAYBACK_STARTED     |
      | Finish playback    | PLAYBACK_FINISHED    |
      | Interrupt playback | PLAYBACK_INTERRUPTED |
      | Device error       | PLAYBACK_ERROR       |
      | Volume change      | AUDIO_VOLUME_CHANGED |
    And event data should include relevant metadata
    And events should be published in correct sequence

  @configuration_integration
  Scenario: Configuration system integration
    Given the Audio Player Service uses the Configuration Manager
    And audio output settings are configured:
      | Setting        | Value  |
      | device_id      | 1      |
      | sample_rate    | 22050  |
      | volume         | 0.8    |
      | buffer_size    | 2048   |
    When the service initializes
    Then it should use the configured settings
    And settings should be validated for correctness
    And invalid settings should use safe defaults
    And configuration changes should be applied dynamically
