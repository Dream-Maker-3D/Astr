@speech @recognition @whisper
Feature: Speech Recognition Service - Whisper STT Integration
  As a voice assistant user
  I want the system to accurately transcribe my speech to text
  So that the AI can understand and respond to my natural conversation

  Background:
    Given the Speech Recognition Service is available
    And the Event Bus Service is running
    And the Configuration Manager is initialized
    And the Audio Capture Service is providing audio data
    And the system is ready for speech processing

  @smoke @critical
  Scenario: Speech Recognition Service initialization
    Given the Speech Recognition Service is not yet initialized
    When I initialize the Speech Recognition Service
    Then the service should load the configured Whisper model
    And the service should validate model compatibility
    And the service should configure processing parameters
    And the service should register with the Event Bus
    And the service should be ready to process audio

  @model_loading
  Scenario: Whisper model loading and validation
    Given the Speech Recognition Service is initializing
    And the configuration specifies Whisper model settings:
      | Model Size | Model Path           | Language | Device |
      | base       | models/whisper-base  | auto     | cpu    |
      | small      | models/whisper-small | en       | cpu    |
      | medium     | models/whisper-medium| auto     | gpu    |
    When I load the Whisper model
    Then the model should be loaded successfully
    And the model capabilities should be validated
    And the processing device should be configured
    And model metadata should be available for queries

  @strategy_pattern
  Scenario: STT Strategy implementation
    Given the Speech Recognition Service uses the Strategy pattern
    And multiple STT strategies are available:
      | Strategy Class    | Provider | Model Type | Capabilities        |
      | WhisperSTTStrategy| OpenAI   | Whisper    | Multilingual, Fast  |
      | FastWhisperSTT    | Faster   | Whisper    | Optimized, Streaming|
      | CloudSTTStrategy  | Cloud    | Various    | High Accuracy       |
    When I configure the STT strategy to "WhisperSTTStrategy"
    Then the service should use the Whisper STT implementation
    And the strategy should be properly initialized
    And the interface should remain consistent across strategies

  @real_time_processing
  Scenario: Real-time audio transcription
    Given the Speech Recognition Service is initialized with Whisper
    And audio data is streaming from the Audio Capture Service
    When I receive continuous audio chunks:
      | Chunk ID | Duration | Audio Quality | Content Type    |
      | chunk1   | 1.0s     | Clear         | Speech          |
      | chunk2   | 0.5s     | Noisy         | Speech + Noise  |
      | chunk3   | 2.0s     | Clear         | Complete phrase |
    Then each audio chunk should be processed in real-time
    And transcription should be generated within 500ms
    And partial results should be available for streaming
    And final transcription should be published via Event Bus

  @language_detection
  Scenario: Automatic language detection
    Given the Speech Recognition Service supports multiple languages
    And the configuration enables automatic language detection
    When I process audio in different languages:
      | Audio Sample | Expected Language | Confidence |
      | "Hello world"| en               | >0.9       |
      | "Bonjour"    | fr               | >0.8       |
      | "Hola mundo" | es               | >0.9       |
      | Mixed speech | auto-detect      | >0.7       |
    Then the service should automatically detect the language
    And use the appropriate language model
    And include language metadata in transcription results
    And handle language switching within conversations

  @confidence_scoring
  Scenario: Transcription confidence assessment
    Given the Speech Recognition Service provides confidence scores
    When I process audio with varying quality:
      | Audio Type        | Expected Confidence | Action Required    |
      | Clear speech      | >0.95              | Accept immediately |
      | Slight background | 0.8-0.95           | Accept with note   |
      | Noisy audio      | 0.5-0.8            | Flag for review    |
      | Unclear mumbling | <0.5               | Request repetition |
    Then confidence scores should be accurate and calibrated
    And low-confidence transcriptions should be flagged
    And appropriate actions should be recommended
    And confidence metadata should be included in results

  @streaming_transcription
  Scenario: Streaming partial transcription results
    Given the Speech Recognition Service supports streaming mode
    And real-time feedback is enabled
    When I speak a long sentence: "This is a comprehensive test of the streaming transcription capabilities"
    Then partial transcriptions should be generated progressively:
      | Time | Partial Result                                    | Status    |
      | 0.5s | "This is"                                       | Partial   |
      | 1.0s | "This is a comprehensive"                       | Partial   |
      | 1.5s | "This is a comprehensive test"                  | Partial   |
      | 2.0s | "This is a comprehensive test of the streaming" | Partial   |
      | 2.5s | "This is a comprehensive test of the streaming transcription capabilities" | Final |
    And each partial result should include confidence scores
    And the final result should be the most accurate

  @punctuation_restoration
  Scenario: Natural punctuation and formatting
    Given the Speech Recognition Service includes punctuation restoration
    When I speak naturally without explicit punctuation:
      | Spoken Text                                    | Expected Transcription                        |
      | "Hello how are you today"                     | "Hello, how are you today?"                   |
      | "I need to buy milk eggs and bread"           | "I need to buy milk, eggs, and bread."       |
      | "What time is it"                             | "What time is it?"                            |
      | "The meeting is at three thirty PM tomorrow"  | "The meeting is at 3:30 PM tomorrow."        |
    Then the transcription should include natural punctuation
    And capitalization should be appropriate
    And numbers should be formatted correctly
    And the text should be readable and natural

  @disfluency_handling
  Scenario: Natural speech pattern processing
    Given the Speech Recognition Service handles natural speech patterns
    When I speak with natural disfluencies:
      | Spoken Input                                   | Expected Processing                           |
      | "Um, I think, uh, we should go"               | "I think we should go" (cleaned)              |
      | "The meeting is at, let me see, three o'clock"| "The meeting is at three o'clock" (cleaned)  |
      | "Can you, sorry, could you help me"           | "Could you help me" (corrected)              |
      | "I want to, actually no, I need to go"        | "I need to go" (self-corrected)              |
    Then filler words should be appropriately handled
    And self-corrections should be processed naturally
    And the final transcription should be clean and coherent
    And original disfluencies should be available if needed

  @turn_detection
  Scenario: Conversation turn boundary detection
    Given the Speech Recognition Service detects conversation turns
    And the system supports natural conversation flow
    When I have a conversation with natural pauses:
      | Speech Segment | Pause Duration | Turn Type        |
      | "Hello there"  | 0.5s          | Continuation     |
      | "How are you"  | 2.0s          | Turn boundary    |
      | "I'm fine"     | 0.3s          | Quick response   |
      | "Thanks"       | 3.0s          | Conversation end |
    Then turn boundaries should be detected accurately
    And appropriate events should be published for each turn
    And conversation context should be maintained across turns
    And natural conversation flow should be preserved

  @error_handling
  Scenario: Transcription error handling and recovery
    Given the Speech Recognition Service handles various error conditions
    When transcription encounters errors:
      | Error Type           | Scenario                    | Expected Behavior              |
      | Model loading failed | Corrupted model file        | Fallback to backup model       |
      | Audio format error   | Unsupported audio format    | Request format conversion      |
      | Processing timeout   | Very long audio segment     | Chunk processing with timeout  |
      | Memory exhaustion    | Large audio buffer          | Streaming processing mode      |
      | Network failure      | Cloud model unavailable     | Switch to local model          |
    Then appropriate error handling should occur
    And fallback strategies should be employed
    And error events should be published to the Event Bus
    And the system should recover gracefully without crashing

  @performance_optimization
  Scenario: Low-latency speech processing
    Given the Speech Recognition Service is optimized for real-time performance
    And performance targets are defined:
      | Metric                    | Target Value | Measurement Method |
      | Processing latency        | <500ms       | End-to-end timing  |
      | Memory usage              | <512MB       | Peak memory usage  |
      | CPU utilization           | <50%         | Average during use |
      | Transcription accuracy    | >95%         | Word error rate    |
    When I process continuous speech for 5 minutes
    Then all performance targets should be met consistently
    And latency should remain stable under load
    And memory usage should not grow over time
    And accuracy should be maintained throughout

  @context_awareness
  Scenario: Conversation context integration
    Given the Speech Recognition Service maintains conversation context
    And previous conversation history is available
    When I speak with contextual references:
      | Previous Context                    | Current Speech           | Expected Enhancement        |
      | "I'm planning a trip to Paris"     | "When should I go there" | "go there" → "go to Paris"  |
      | "My favorite color is blue"        | "I like that one too"    | Context-aware processing    |
      | "The meeting is at 3 PM"           | "Can we move it later"   | "it" → "the meeting"        |
    Then contextual information should enhance transcription accuracy
    And ambiguous references should be resolved when possible
    And context should be maintained across conversation turns
    And enhanced transcriptions should be marked as context-aware

  @multi_speaker_handling
  Scenario: Multiple speaker detection and handling
    Given the Speech Recognition Service can handle multiple speakers
    When audio contains multiple speakers:
      | Speaker | Speech Content              | Voice Characteristics |
      | User    | "Hello, how are you today?" | Primary speaker       |
      | Other   | "I'm doing well, thanks"    | Background speaker    |
      | User    | "That's great to hear"      | Primary speaker       |
    Then the service should focus on the primary speaker
    And background speech should be filtered appropriately
    And speaker changes should be detected when relevant
    And transcription should prioritize the main conversation

  @integration_testing
  Scenario: Event Bus integration for speech events
    Given the Speech Recognition Service is integrated with the Event Bus
    When speech processing events occur:
      | Event Trigger              | Expected Event Type           | Event Data                    |
      | Transcription started      | TRANSCRIPTION_STARTED         | audio_id, timestamp           |
      | Partial result available   | TRANSCRIPTION_PARTIAL         | text, confidence, audio_id    |
      | Transcription completed    | TRANSCRIPTION_COMPLETED       | final_text, confidence, metadata |
      | Language detected          | LANGUAGE_DETECTED             | language, confidence          |
      | Processing error           | TRANSCRIPTION_ERROR           | error_type, message, audio_id |
    Then appropriate events should be published to the Event Bus
    And event data should include all relevant metadata
    And other services should be able to subscribe to speech events
    And event timing should be accurate and consistent

  @configuration_integration
  Scenario: Configuration system integration
    Given the Speech Recognition Service uses the Configuration Manager
    And speech recognition settings are configured:
      | Setting                | Value        | Description                    |
      | model_size            | base         | Whisper model size             |
      | language              | auto         | Target language (auto-detect)  |
      | enable_streaming      | true         | Enable partial transcriptions  |
      | confidence_threshold  | 0.7          | Minimum confidence for results |
      | max_segment_length    | 30           | Maximum audio segment (seconds)|
      | enable_punctuation    | true         | Add punctuation to results     |
    When the service initializes and processes speech
    Then it should use the configured settings
    And settings should be validated for correctness
    And invalid settings should use safe defaults
    And configuration changes should be applied dynamically when possible

  @resource_management
  Scenario: Proper resource cleanup and management
    Given the Speech Recognition Service manages system resources
    And the service has been processing speech for extended periods
    When I shutdown the Speech Recognition Service
    Then all Whisper models should be unloaded properly
    And audio processing threads should be terminated cleanly
    And memory buffers should be released
    And temporary files should be cleaned up
    And no resource leaks should occur
    And the service should be ready for restart if needed
