Feature: Speech Synthesis Service - Coqui TTS Integration
  As a voice assistant user
  I want the system to convert text responses to natural-sounding speech
  So that I can hear the assistant's responses in a human-like voice

  Background:
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is available
    And the Event Bus Service is running
    And the Configuration Manager is initialized
    And the Audio Player Service is ready for playback
    And the system is ready for speech synthesis

  @smoke @critical
  Scenario: Speech Synthesis Service initialization
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is not yet initialized
    When I initialize the Speech Synthesis Service
    Then the service should load the configured Coqui TTS model
    And the service should validate model compatibility
    And the service should configure voice parameters
    And the service should register with the Event Bus
    And the service should be ready to synthesize speech

  @model_loading
  Scenario: Coqui TTS model loading and validation
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is initializing
    And the configuration specifies TTS model settings:
      | Model Name                                    | Voice ID      | Language | Device |
      | tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2 | female_young  | en       | cpu    |
      | tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC          | ljspeech      | en       | cpu    |
    When I load the Coqui TTS model
    Then the model should be loaded successfully
    And the model capabilities should be validated
    And the processing device should be configured
    And available voices should be enumerated

  @basic_synthesis
  Scenario: Basic text-to-speech synthesis
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is initialized with Coqui TTS
    And the selected voice is "female_young"
    When I request synthesis of text: "Hello, how can I help you today?"
    Then the service should generate audio within 300ms
    And the audio should be in the configured format (22kHz, WAV)
    And the audio duration should match the text length appropriately
    And a "SYNTHESIS_COMPLETED" event should be published
    And the audio should be queued for playback

  @voice_selection
  Scenario: Voice selection and customization
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service supports multiple voices
    And available voices include:
      | Voice ID      | Gender | Age   | Language | Style      |
      | female_young  | Female | Young | en       | Natural    |
      | male_mature   | Male   | Adult | en       | Professional |
      | female_warm   | Female | Adult | en       | Friendly   |
    When I configure the voice to "female_warm"
    Then the service should use the specified voice for synthesis
    And subsequent synthesis should use the new voice
    And voice characteristics should be consistent

  @real_time_synthesis
  Scenario: Real-time synthesis for conversation
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is optimized for real-time conversation
    When I receive AI responses for synthesis:
      | Response Text                           | Expected Latency | Priority |
      | "I understand."                        | <150ms          | High     |
      | "Let me think about that for a moment." | <200ms          | Normal   |
    Then each response should be synthesized within the expected latency
    And high-priority responses should be processed first
    And synthesis should not block other system operations

  @error_handling
  Scenario: Synthesis error handling and recovery
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service handles various error conditions
    When synthesis encounters errors:
      | Error Type           | Scenario                    | Expected Behavior              |
      | Model loading failed | Corrupted model file        | Fallback to backup model       |
      | Invalid text input   | Empty or malformed text     | Return appropriate error       |
      | Voice not found      | Requested voice missing     | Use default voice with warning |
    Then appropriate error handling should occur
    And fallback strategies should be employed
    And error events should be published to the Event Bus

  @performance_optimization
  Scenario: Low-latency speech synthesis
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is optimized for real-time performance
    And performance targets are defined:
      | Metric                    | Target Value | Measurement Method |
      | Synthesis latency         | <300ms       | End-to-end timing  |
      | Memory usage              | <1GB         | Peak memory usage  |
      | Audio quality (MOS)       | >4.0         | Mean Opinion Score |
    When I process continuous synthesis for 5 minutes
    Then all performance targets should be met consistently
    And latency should remain stable under load
    And audio quality should be maintained throughout

  @integration_events
  Scenario: Event Bus integration for synthesis events
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service is integrated with the Event Bus
    When various synthesis operations occur:
      | Operation              | Event Type                | Event Data                    |
      | Start synthesis        | SYNTHESIS_STARTED         | text_id, text_length, voice   |
      | Synthesis complete     | SYNTHESIS_COMPLETED       | text_id, audio_file, metadata  |
      | Synthesis error        | SYNTHESIS_ERROR           | error_type, message, text_id   |
    Then appropriate events should be published to the Event Bus
    And event data should include all relevant metadata
    And other services should be able to subscribe to synthesis events

  @configuration_integration
  Scenario: Configuration system integration
    Given the Speech Synthesis Service uses the Configuration Manager
    And speech synthesis settings are configured:
      | Setting              | Value                    | Description                    |
      | model_name          | xtts_v2                  | TTS model to use               |
      | voice_id            | female_young             | Default voice selection        |
      | speaking_rate       | 1.1                      | Speech rate multiplier         |
      | audio_format        | wav                      | Output audio format            |
      | sample_rate         | 22050                    | Audio sample rate (Hz)         |
    When the service initializes and processes synthesis requests
    Then it should use the configured settings
    And settings should be validated for correctness
    And invalid settings should use safe defaults
