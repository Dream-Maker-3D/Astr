Feature: Natural Voice Conversation with Claude AI
  As a user
  I want to have seamless, natural conversations like talking to a person
  So that I can interact naturally without prompts, wake words, or robotic responses

  Background:
    Given the voice assistant system is in natural conversation mode
    And Whisper STT is loaded and ready for continuous listening
    And Coqui TTS is loaded with a natural voice model
    And Claude API is configured for conversational responses
    And audio input/output devices are working
    And the system is continuously listening without activation words

  Scenario: Seamless conversation startup
    Given the voice assistant is not running
    When I start the voice assistant
    Then the system should initialize silently in the background
    And begin continuous listening without any prompts
    And not announce "Ready to listen" or similar activation messages
    And be ready to respond naturally when I start speaking

  Scenario: Natural conversation initiation
    Given the voice assistant is continuously listening
    When I naturally start speaking "I'm thinking about buying a new laptop"
    Then the system should immediately detect my speech
    And begin processing without any activation words
    And respond conversationally about laptops
    And not ask "How can I help you?" or formal assistant prompts

  Scenario: Concise conversational responses
    Given I ask "What's the weather like today?"
    When Claude responds
    Then the response should be brief and natural like "It's sunny and 72 degrees"
    And not include verbose explanations like "I'll help you check the weather"
    And sound like something a person would say in conversation
    And not reference being an AI assistant

  Scenario: Handling background noise and unclear speech
    Given the voice assistant is listening
    When I speak with background noise or unclear pronunciation
    Then the system should attempt to filter the noise
    And if transcription confidence is low, it should ask me to repeat
    And it should say "I didn't catch that, could you please repeat?"

  Scenario: Conversation context preservation
    Given I have already had a conversation with the assistant
    When I ask a follow-up question like "Tell me more about that"
    Then the system should maintain conversation context
    And Claude should reference our previous discussion
    And provide a relevant response based on context

  Scenario: Voice activity detection
    Given the voice assistant is listening
    When there is silence or only background noise
    Then the system should not trigger transcription
    And should continue listening without processing
    When I start speaking
    Then the system should detect voice activity
    And begin recording my speech

  Scenario: Natural interruption handling
    Given Claude is saying "The best laptops for programming are typically MacBooks because they have..."
    When I interrupt by saying "What about Windows laptops?"
    Then Claude should immediately stop speaking
    And respond naturally to my Windows laptop question
    And not acknowledge being interrupted or apologize
    And continue the conversation seamlessly about Windows options

  Scenario: Accepting corrections gracefully
    Given Claude just said "Python is compiled language"
    When I correct with "No, Python is interpreted"
    Then Claude should accept the correction naturally
    And say something like "You're right, Python is interpreted"
    And not be defensive or verbose about the correction
    And continue the conversation with the corrected information

  Scenario: Natural clarification requests
    Given I say something vague like "Can you help me with that coding thing?"
    When Claude needs more information
    Then it should ask naturally like "Which coding topic are you thinking about?"
    And not use formal language like "I need more information to assist you"
    And sound like a person asking for clarification

  Scenario: Audio device configuration
    Given multiple microphones are available
    When I configure the preferred microphone in settings
    Then the system should use the selected microphone for audio capture
    And should provide clear audio quality feedback
    When I test the microphone
    Then I should see audio level indicators
    And hear clear audio playback

  Scenario: Real-time conversation flow
    Given the voice assistant is in conversation mode
    When I say "Tell me a joke"
    Then Claude should respond with a joke within 3 seconds
    And I should hear the complete joke
    When the joke finishes playing
    Then the system should automatically return to listening mode
    And be ready for my next input

  Scenario: System shutdown and cleanup
    Given the voice assistant is running
    When I request to stop the assistant
    Then all audio capture should stop
    And all models should be properly unloaded
    And system resources should be cleaned up
    And the system should display "Voice assistant stopped"

  Scenario: Voice quality and naturalness
    Given Claude has generated a text response
    When the text is converted to speech using Coqui TTS
    Then the voice should sound natural and human-like
    And pronunciation should be clear and accurate
    And the speaking pace should be comfortable
    And emotional tone should match the content

  Scenario: Multi-turn conversation
    Given I start a conversation with "Hi there"
    When Claude responds with a greeting
    And I follow up with "What can you help me with?"
    And Claude explains its capabilities
    And I ask "Can you help me with Python programming?"
    Then Claude should provide relevant programming assistance
    And maintain context throughout the multi-turn conversation
    And each response should build naturally on the previous exchange
